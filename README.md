# 🎓 Mentorness Internship - Batch MIP-DA-10

Welcome to my repository for the Mentorness Internship! This repository showcases the tasks I completed as part of Batch MIP-DA-10, where I honed my data analysis and visualization skills using SQL and Power BI.

## 🌟 Internship Tasks Overview

### 1. 🎬 Reel Task: Indexing Overview in SQL
**Topic:** Indexing Overview: Introduction to indexes and their role in improving query performance by speeding up data retrieval.

In this task, I created with **Canva** an engaging reel to explain the concept of indexing in SQL. The reel covers:
- ☑️ 𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒊𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒙𝒆𝒔 𝒂𝒓𝒆: A brief introduction to indexes in SQL and their purpose.
- ☑️ 𝑯𝒐𝒘 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒚 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌: An overview of how indexes speed up data retrieval by organizing data in a way that allows faster searches.
- ☑️ 𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒇𝒐𝒓𝒎𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒆 𝑰𝒎𝒑𝒂𝒄𝒕: How indexes can significantly improve query performance but may come with trade-offs.
